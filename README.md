A heartrate monitoring app for firefighters


## Notes
- Branches should be created for each new feature and merged once the feature is confirmed tested and working by other contributors.
- DO NOT FORK. Forking will copy the repo to your account and treat it as a separate, distinct project.
- Do not merge a branch until it has been discussed and approved by other members
- Use Issues to suggest features, describe bugs, etc. and close them as they are resolved
  - *Issues, commits, branches, etc. can all be referenced in comments and other posts. For example, a commit message can reference an issue: "Add feature X as described in issue #35"*
- Be descriptive in your commit messages, e.g. "Update README" vs "Add list of guidelines to README"
  - *Note for commit messages: It is common practice to write them in present tense, e.g. "Add feature" instead of "Added feature"*
